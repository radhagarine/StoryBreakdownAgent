INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

A cozy coffee shop bustling with early morning customers. Steam rises from freshly brewed coffee.

SARAH
(to barista)
One large cappuccino, please.

JAMES, a regular customer in his 30s, sits at his usual corner table.

JAMES
Sarah? Is that you?

SARAH turns, surprised to see a familiar face.

SARAH
James! I haven't seen you in ages!

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

Sarah and James sit at an outdoor table, their coffee steaming in the crisp morning air.

SARAH
So what brings you back to town?

JAMES
(hesitating)
It's... complicated.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - FLASHBACK

A younger James sits at the same corner table, surrounded by books and papers.
